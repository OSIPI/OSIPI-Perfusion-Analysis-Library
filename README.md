# OSIPI-Perfusion-Analysis-Library (OPAL)
Harmonized library for perfusion imaging analysis, compiled from contributions to the DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection

OPAL is currently at the design stage. The latest design specification is [here](https://github.com/OSIPI/OSIPI-Perfusion-Analysis-Library/blob/develop/docs/OPAL_design_specification.md).

Meanwhile, we are collecting and validating code contributed by the perfusion community. Please visit the [DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection) repository for details.
