# How to contribute to the OSIPI-DCE-DSC-Toolbox

The structure of the main OSIPI-DCE-DSC toolbox is still under design.

The repository has branches `main` and `develop` (the default) which we are currently keeping clean.

If you would like to help during the initial design phase, pease either:

- Fork from `develop` and work in your own copy of the repository

- If you would like to add your work back to the OSIPI repository, create a new branch `develop_<yourinitials>`, and submit a PR to merge your fork to your person develop branch

Once the OSIPI TF2.3 team have decided on a more stable design it will be possible to make PRs around specific issues, that can be merged directly on the `develop` branch. We will update instructions for contributing when we have reached this stage.

Thank-you for any contributions you make. Please contact @michaelberks, @petravanhoudt or @mjt320 for more information.
